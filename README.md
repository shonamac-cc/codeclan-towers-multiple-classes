# codeclan-towers-multiple-classes

You are being asked to build a booking system for the new CodeClan Towers hotel.

Use TDD in Junit to model the Hotel with Java classes, with separate test files for each class.

## MVP

- Create a `Guest` class to represent a visitor to the hotel, they'll at least need a name, you can add more properties later if and when they become necessary
- Create 2 different types of rooms:
  - `Bedroom`s will have a room number, capacity, collection of `Guest`s and a type (e.g. Single/Double.)
  - `ConferenceRoom`s will have a capacity, collection of Guests, name and any other properties you wish.
- Create a `Hotel` class, which has collections of rooms of different types.
- The `Hotel` will be able check guests in/out of rooms.

### Extensions

- Create a `Booking` class which contains a `Bedroom` and a number of nights booked.
- Create a `bookRoom` method in your `Hotel`. This should book a given `Bedroom` for a number of nights. This should return a new `Booking` object.
- Add a nightly rate to your `Bedroom`s and write a method to return the total bill for the `Booking`.

### Advanced Extensions

- Add functionality to the `Hotel` so it can return a collection of only the vacant `Bedroom`s.
- Update the check-in process so that `Hotel` will only be able to check guests into empty `Bedroom`s.
- Any other extensions you can think of!
